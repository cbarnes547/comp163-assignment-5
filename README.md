For challenge 1, I used a while loop because the number of steps is unknown in, and the loop must continue until the sequence reaches 1. For challenge 2 and 3, I used for loops since I needed to test through a specific range of divisors and print through a set range of numbers. Challenge 1 keeps changing the starting number by dividing it by 2 if it’s even or multiplying by 3 and adding 1 if it’s odd, and it counts how many steps it takes to reach 1. Challenge 2 goes through smaller numbers to see if any divide evenly into the number and stops as soon as it finds one. Then challenge 3  just uses loops inside loops to print out a grid of all the products. I used AI to help explain and review the code and suggest improvements but the code was written by me. I just like insight.
